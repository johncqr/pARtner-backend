        <h1>What are Coping Mechanisms?</h1>
        <p>No matter how mentally healthy, resilient, or happy you are, there comes a time in every person’s life when he or she will need to cope with something difficult. Coping is something we all do, whether we do it consciously or without thinking.</p>
        <p>It’s watching a funny movie when we’re sad, calling a friend to help you get through a breakup, or going out for a drink after a work day that didn’t go well.</p>
        <p>Some ways we cope are healthy and build resilience, while others simply help us avoid the real problems or encourage destructive behavior.</p>
        <p>In this piece, we’ll provide tons of examples of healthy coping techniques, a few examples of some negative coping methods, and some worksheets that can help you learn how to cope in a more positive way.</p>
