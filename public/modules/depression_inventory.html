        <p>INTERPRETING THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY Now that you have completed the questionnaire, add up the score for each of the twenty-one questions by counting the number to the right of each question you marked. The highest possible total for the whole test would be sixty-three. This would mean you circled number three on all twenty-one questions. Since the lowest possible score for each question is zero, the lowest possible score for the test would be zero. This would mean you circles zero on each question. You can evaluate your depression according to the Table below. </p>
        <p>
            1-10  These ups and downs are considered normal <br>
            11-16 Mild mood disturbance <br>
            17-20  Borderline clinical depression<br>
            21-30  Moderate depression <br>
            31-40  Severe depression <br>
            over 40  Extreme depression <br>
